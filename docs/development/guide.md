:wave: Welcome! Getting started with Clutch development is easy. Clutch has a number of extension points that make it easy to customize for a new use case without forks or rewrites.

Familiarizing yourself with concepts in the [Architecture Reference](/docs/about/architecture) is recommended prior to starting development.
