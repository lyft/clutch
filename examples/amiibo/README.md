# Amiibo Example

This is an example of the final output from walking through the
[Feature Development](https://clutch.sh/docs/development/feature) guide.

Included in this example are:
- API changes within [api/](./api)
- Backend changes within [backend/](./backend)
- Frontend changes within [frontend](./frontend)

This is purely to demonstrate the final output of the manual changes required and does not include
generated API code.
